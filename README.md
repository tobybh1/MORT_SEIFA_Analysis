# Using socioeconomic indexes to predict diabetes mortality rates: an analysis of the AIHW MORT books
This is the repository for a project completed as an assignment at the Australian National University (ANU). I was interested in finding a correlation between socioeconomics and mortality, however using these datasets the correlation was not particularly strong so I pivoted my focus to deaths caused by diabetes. This also gave me the chance to build a regression model which could be used to impute missing values. Despite being early on in my data science career, I have seen the large amount of missing or inaccurate data that exists and the strong need to make estimations, so I thought this project would give me a chance to predict values based on other factors, in this case predicting diabetes death rates based on the socioeconomic indexes of that particular LGA. Included in this repo is also a report and scientific poster summarising my findings.
